# HANGMAN_PYTHON
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player thinks of a word, and tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure (representing a hanging man) is drawn. The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the entire stick figure is drawn, indicating a loss. In the game, countryâ€™s names are to be guessed by the player. By focusing on countries, the game provides an opportunity for players to learn about geography in an interactive and entertaining way. Players can familiarize themselves with the names of countries and their spellings while playing the game. The game can promote cultural awareness by highlighting aspects of different countries, such as their landmarks, languages, and traditions. This fosters curiosity and appreciation for global diversity. The game challenges players' cognitive skills, including vocabulary, pattern recognition, and problem-solving abilities. Players must use logic and deduction to guess the country names based on limited information.With the inclusion of a timer, the game offers an engaging and dynamic experience for players. The timer adds tension and excitement ensuring that the game remains enjoyable and challenging. The Hangman game can be enjoyed by players of all ages and can be a fun activity for families, friends, or classrooms. Players can collaborate or compete with each other to guess the country names, fostering social interaction and teamwork.
In this project, we aim to develop a Hangman game implementation in Python with integrated Git version control.
The objective of this project is twofold:
1.	Implementing Hangman Game: Develop a fully functional Hangman game in Python that allows players to guess country names within a limited number of attempts. The game include features such as country-specific word selection, a timer, an instruction page.
2.	Git Integration: Integrate Git version control into the Hangman game project to facilitate collaborative development, version tracking, and code management. Use Git for source code management, allowing multiple developers to work on the project concurrently while maintaining version history and managing code changes.
